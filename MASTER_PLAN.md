# MASTER PLAN — Inhibitory Chokepoints in the Drosophila Brain
### The definitive project document: requirements → verified novelty → frozen hypothesis → experiments → status

**Version:** 2.0 (2026-09-15, post-audit)
**Supersedes:** research_plan.md Parts 4–8 (lit survey + hypotheses) — those remain valid for dataset audit (Parts 1–3) but the novelty verdict below is the authoritative one.
**Inputs:** `review.md` (raw-data audit), `research_plan.md` (strategy), `literature/literature_review.csv` (19 verified papers), `RESEARCH_LOG.md` (executed experiments).

## 1. Project definition

**Working title:** *Inhibitory Chokepoints in the Drosophila Brain: A Neurotransmitter-Resolved Network Analysis of Information Flow*

**Research question:**
> Does inhibitory (GABAergic) identity predict per-neuron control impact on whole-brain information flow **beyond** what degree, strength, and centrality already explain — tested by structural neuron-removal perturbation with degree-matched controls and degree-preserving nulls on the adult FAFB connectome?

**The one rule:** never call anything novel because we haven't personally seen it; never call anything a discovery before statistical testing; never modify a raw file.

## 3. Novelty verdict — audit-corrected, primary-source-verified

### 3.1 What the audit changed

The pre-audit matrix claimed "Lin 2024: no node removal." **Primary-source reading (PMC11446825, full text) falsified that:** Lin et al. DID degree-ordered neuron-removal survival curves (Fig 1f,g; ED Fig 2a–d). The corrected gap therefore rests on the four-way combination below, and on two additional verified facts that *shrink* the claim space further:

- **Lin used v630** (127,978 neurons / 2,613,129 connections), not v783 — our baseline numbers (139,255 / 3,732,460) differ for that reason, not error.
- **Lin already showed "high-total-degree neurons are mostly GABAergic"** (ED Fig 3d) — so our E02 GABA-strength signal is a **replication** of Lin, not a finding. (It remains useful as a pipeline-correctness check: our independent pipeline reproduced their qualitative result.)

### 3.2 The verified gap (what survives the audit)

No published work combines, on the adult FAFB connectome:
1. **per-neuron** control-impact perturbation (remove neuron → measure communication loss → rank); Lin's removal is degree-ordered aggregate survival, not per-neuron ranking;
2. **neurotransmitter-conditioned** comparison (inhibitory vs excitatory vs glut vs modulatory); Lin's NT use is descriptive composition of motifs/reciprocity;
3. **degree-matched controls** (compare GABA vs ACh neurons at matched degree); absent from every verified paper;
4. **degree-preserving null validation of the impact ranking** (Maslov–Sneppen z-scores).

Also verified: Shiu 2024 = simulated activity manipulation of neuron sets (not structural removal ranking); Uzel 2022 = C. elegans hub-removal without NT controls; Winding 2023 = larval descriptive centrality (the purported larval "removal companion" paper does not exist and was removed from the matrix); brainwide_visual_2026 = pathway-level flow, no per-neuron validation.

**Verdict:** novelty is **"probable and precisely bounded"** — defensible for starting E03, not yet publication-grade proof. Publication-grade proof additionally requires (a) a dedicated search of 2025–2026 preprint servers (bioRxiv/arXiv q-bio) with the exact phrase set in §5, (b) a CODEX/FlyWire community check for in-preparation work, and (c) re-verification of all 19 matrix rows' bibliographic details (DOI-level) at submission time. These are tracked as pre-submission gates, not blockers for the experiment.

## 4. Frozen hypothesis (v2, post-audit)

> **H1 (frozen 2026-09-15, v2):** Inhibitory neurons have disproportionately large per-neuron control impact on network information flow relative to their degree, **beyond the degree-GABA association already documented by Lin et al. (2024)** — i.e., after degree-matching and degree-preserving nulls, inhibitory identity still predicts control impact.

H1 v1 (pre-audit) is superseded: it failed to account for Lin's GABA-degree finding. The v2 wording bakes the replication duty in: **any claim must be residual-to-degree, not raw.**

**NT policy (unchanged, safer than binary):** GABA → inhibitory; ACh → excitatory; GLUT → separate (sign context-dependent; Lin note: in fly brain glutamate has largely been observed inhibitory — sensitivity analysis will test GLUT-as-inhibitory); DA/SER/OCT → modulatory; unknown → retained, excluded from E/I comparisons.

## 5. Experiments (E01–E08) — exact data, methods, statistics

**E01 — Pipeline (DONE, log E01).** Loaders with verified quirks handling (CRLF, per-neuropil rows, mangled-ID reconstruction for T3, orphan-SWC exclusion); validation (18-digit ID regex, duplicate keys, in-metadata fractions); pair-collapse (sum syn_count; majority NT by synapse-weighted count). Outputs: `data/processed/{neuron_core,graph_pairs}.parquet`, `build_report.json`.

**E02 — Baseline (DONE, log E02).** Global: n, mean degree 26.8, density 1.92e-4, reciprocity 0.083, 875 WCCs (largest 98.4%). By-NT table (key row: GABA n=16,017, mean in-strength 754 vs ACh 318 — the Lin-replication signal). Outputs in `results/tables/`.

**E03 — Chokepoint perturbation (NEXT).**
- *Data:* `graph_pairs.parquet` + `neuron_core.parquet`.
- *Graph:* binary digraph on the 137,679-node thresholded connectome; per-neuropil variant for regional analyses.
- *Performance metric:* global efficiency on sampled source set (n≈1,000 sources; exact on ≤5,000-node subgraphs). CIS(i) = (Eff(G) − Eff(G−i)) / Eff(G).
- *Targets:* union of top-1% by degree, in/out-strength, PageRank, sampled betweenness (k≈512 sources); plus random-degree control sample; plus all GABA neurons with degree in the top decile of GABA degrees.
- *Controls:* (a) degree-matched ACh partners (±10% window) for every high-impact GABA hit; (b) strength-matched variants; (c) superclass-stratified matching as sensitivity.
- *Statistics:* Wilcoxon signed-rank on matched pairs; linear model CIS ~ degree + strength + nt_sign (+ superclass FE); permutation p-values; BH-FDR.
- *Success criteria:* Outcome A = inhibitory excess in CIS persists after matching (median ΔCIS > 0, q < 0.05); Outcome B = regional/class-specific excess only; Outcome C = no excess after matching (report "topology explains control; NT identity adds nothing" — publishable null).

**E04 — Null models.** Maslov–Sneppen degree-preserving rewires (n≥100; more if z marginal) on the binary graph; recompute CIS ranking per replicate; z-scores + BH-FDR for (i) per-neuron CIS, (ii) GABA-enrichment of top-k chokepoint sets. Null implementations already staged in `src/experiments/null_models.py`.

**E05 — Robustness.** Repeat E03–E04 on: (a) no-threshold Princeton edges; (b) Buhmann edges; (c) threshold ∈ {2, 5, 10}; (d) GLUT-as-inhibitory sensitivity; (e) QC weighting by `synapse_attachment_rates.proof_ratio`. Report concordance of top-100 chokepoint sets (Jaccard) and sign stability of the matched-pair effect.

**E06 — Signed motifs around chokepoints.** 3-node signed motif census (FFI, disinhibition, reciprocal E–I) in the 1-hop and 2-hop neighborhoods of top chokepoints vs degree-matched non-chokepoints; enrichment z-scores vs Maslov–Sneppen ensemble. Extends (not repeats) Lin's whole-brain descriptive motif counts by conditioning on chokepoint membership.

**E07 — Biological interpretation.** Map chokepoints to `consolidated_cell_types`, `classification.super_class`, neuropils (via edge tables), `coordinates` (soma position), `connectivity_tags` (rich-club/reciprocal overlap); FBbt cross-refs via `processed_labels`. Deliverable: chokepoint atlas table with anatomical identity and literature cross-refs.

**E08 — AI prediction layer (gated).** Only after E03–E07 pass review: features (degree, strength, PageRank, betweenness, NT, class, neuropil, local motif counts) → predict CIS; XGBoost/RF with SHAP-style importance; question: "can expensive perturbation be predicted from cheap features?" Explicitly decorative-free: included only if E03–E07 produce a stable target.
